## Contents
- ## Machine Learning:
    - [Convolution Neural Network - Digit Recognizer](https://github.com/melvfnz/data_science_portfolio/blob/master/digit_recognizer.ipynb): Convolutional Neural Network that learns to recognize sequences of digits using data generated by concatenating images from MNIST (Recognizes a digit based on an image).
    - [K-Nearest Neighbors - Social Network Ads Dataset](https://github.com/melvfernandez/data_science_portfolio/blob/master/K_Nearest_Neighbors/K-Nearest%20Neighbors%20On%20Social%20Network%20Ads.ipynb): Using K-NN on customers that bought a SUV from a social network ad.
     - [Monte Carlo Model - Cryptocurrency](https://github.com/melvfernandez/data_science_portfolio/blob/master/Cryptocurrency%20Market%20Analysis.ipynb): Using a probabilistic model on cryptocurrency to find an approximate solution to a numerical problem that would be difficult to solve by other methods.
     - [Machine Learning Regression - Financial Market](https://github.com/melvfnz/data_science_portfolio/blob/master/Regression%20-%20Machine%20Learning.ipynb): Importing from quandl (financial and economical data) to create a simple regression.
    
- ## Data Analysis and Visualization (Python Programming)
    - [Cryptocurrency Market Analysis](https://github.com/melvfernandez/data_science_portfolio/blob/master/Cryptocurrency%20Market%20Analysis.ipynb): Based off my stock market analysis of tech stocks. Change in price over time, daily returns, and behaviour prediction.
    - [Stock Market Analysis of Tech Stocks](https://github.com/melvfernandez/data__scientist_portfolio/blob/master/Stock%20Market%20Analysis%20for%20Tech%20Stocks.ipynb): Analysis of technology stocks including change in price over time, daily returns, and stock behaviour prediction.
    - [Exploratory Data Analysis - Titanic Passenger Information](https://github.com/melvfnz/data_science_portfolio/blob/master/kaggle_titanic.ipynb): Simple analysis of passengers on board the Titanic answering common questions with visualizations.
