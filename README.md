# Data Science and Machine Learning Portfolio
Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed for academic, self learning, and professional purposes. Presented in the form of Jupyter Notebooks.

Tools
  - **Python**: NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib
  - **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn, NLTK 

## Contents
- ## Machine Learning:
    - [K-Nearest Neighbors](https://github.com/felipeagferreira/Data-Science/blob/master/KNN%20e%20Como%20Obter%20o%20melhor%20N%C3%BAmero%20K%20de%20Vizinhos%20Mais%20Pr%C3%B3ximos.ipynb): You've been given a classified data set from a company! They've hidden the feature column names but have given you the data and the target classes.
We'll try to use KNN to create a model that directly predicts a class for a new data point based off of the features.
     - [Machine Learning Regression - Financial Market](https://github.com/felipeagferreira/Data-Science/blob/master/Machine%20Learning/Linear%20Regressions/Housing%20Prices.ipynb): Create a model that allows us to put some characteristics of a house and return an estimate of how much the house would sell..
    
- ## Data Analysis and Visualization (Python Programming)
    - [Cryptocurrency Market Analysis](https://github.com/melvfernandez/data_science_portfolio/blob/master/Cryptocurrency%20Market%20Analysis.ipynb): Based off my stock market analysis of tech stocks. Change in price over time, daily returns, and behaviour prediction.
    - [Stock Market Analysis of Tech Stocks](https://github.com/melvfernandez/data__scientist_portfolio/blob/master/Stock%20Market%20Analysis%20for%20Tech%20Stocks.ipynb): Analysis of technology stocks including change in price over time, daily returns, and stock behaviour prediction.
    - [Exploratory Data Analysis - Titanic Passenger Information](https://github.com/melvfnz/data_science_portfolio/blob/master/kaggle_titanic.ipynb): Simple analysis of passengers on board the Titanic answering common questions with visualizations. 
    - [Exploratory Data Analysis - House Prices](https://github.com/melvfernandez/data_science_portfolio/blob/master/Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis%20of%20House%20Prices.ipynb): Simple analysis of house prices including quick visualizations with correlation plots and heat maps.
     - [Simple Linear Regression](https://github.com/melvfernandez/data_science_portfolio/blob/master/Simple%20Linear%20Regression.ipynb): Small playground to summarize and study relationships between two continuous variables from a randomized dataset.
