## Contents
- ## Machine Learning:
    - [K-Nearest Neighbors](https://github.com/felipeagferreira/Data-Science/blob/master/KNN%20e%20Como%20Obter%20o%20melhor%20N%C3%BAmero%20K%20de%20Vizinhos%20Mais%20Pr%C3%B3ximos.ipynb): You've been given a classified data set from a company! They've hidden the feature column names but have given you the data and the target classes.
We'll try to use KNN to create a model that directly predicts a class for a new data point based off of the features.
     - [Machine Learning Linear Regression - Financial Market](https://github.com/felipeagferreira/Data-Science/blob/master/Machine%20Learning/Linear%20Regressions/Housing%20Prices.ipynb): Create a model that allows us to put some characteristics of a house and return an estimate of how much the house would sell.
     - [Machine Learning Logistic Regression - ](https://github.com/felipeagferreira/Data-Science/blob/master/Machine%20Learning/Logistic%20Regressions/Whether%20or%20not%20a%20particular%20internet%20user%20clicked%20on%20an%20Advertisement.ipynb): Work with a fake advertising data set, indicating whether or not a particular internet user clicked on an Advertisement. We create a model that predicts whether or not they will click on an ad based off the features of that user.
    
- ## Data Analysis and Visualization (Python Programming)
    - [Stock Market Analysis of Tech Stocks](https://github.com/felipeagferreira/Data-Science/blob/master/Data%20Analysis/Financial%20market%20data%20analysis%20project.ipynb): Analysis of exploratory stock price data to see the bank's actions and how they performed during the [financial crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%9308) until the beginning of 2016.
    - [Exploratory Data Analysis - Titanic Passenger Information](https://github.com/felipeagferreira/Data-Science/blob/master/CALIBRAR%20um%20DataFrame%20para%20operar%20com%20REGRESS%C3%83O%20LOG%C3%8DSTICA.ipynb): Simple analysis of passengers on board the Titanic answering common questions with visualizations. 
    - [Simple Linear Regression](https://github.com/felipeagferreira/Data-Science/blob/master/Machine%20Learning/Linear%20Regressions/Clothing%20Shop%20Efficiency.ipynb): Analyze data of a clothing shop to decide whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website in order to improve the efficiency of their business.
