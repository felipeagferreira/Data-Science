## Contents
- ## Machine Learning:
    - [K-Nearest Neighbors](https://github.com/felipeagferreira/Data-Science/blob/master/KNN%20e%20Como%20Obter%20o%20melhor%20N%C3%BAmero%20K%20de%20Vizinhos%20Mais%20Pr%C3%B3ximos.ipynb): You've been given a classified data set from a company! They've hidden the feature column names but have given you the data and the target classes.
We'll try to use KNN to create a model that directly predicts a class for a new data point based off of the features.
     - [Machine Learning Linear Regression - Financial Market](https://github.com/felipeagferreira/Data-Science/blob/master/Machine%20Learning/Linear%20Regressions/Housing%20Prices.ipynb): Create a model that allows us to put some characteristics of a house and return an estimate of how much the house would sell.
     - [Machine Learning Logistic Regression](https://github.com/felipeagferreira/Data-Science/blob/master/Machine%20Learning/Logistic%20Regressions/Whether%20or%20not%20a%20particular%20internet%20user%20clicked%20on%20an%20Advertisement.ipynb): Work with a fake advertising data set, indicating whether or not a particular internet user clicked on an Advertisement. We create a model that predicts whether or not they will click on an ad based off the features of that user.
     - [Support Vector Machines](https://github.com/felipeagferreira/Data-Science/blob/master/Montar%20um%20DataFrame%20para%20Support%20Vector%20Machine.ipynb): Work with Scikit Learn's built-in breast cancer data set to build a Support Vector Machine classifier model to predict whether or not there was a breast cancer. Furthermore, use GridSearchCV to find the best parameters of the SVM classifier model. 
     - [K Means Clustering](https://github.com/felipeagferreira/Data-Science/blob/master/Projeto%20de%20K%20Means%20Clustering%20com%20BONS%20PLOTS.ipynb): Use KMeans Clustering algorithm to group Universities into two groups: Private or Public.
     - [Random Forests](https://github.com/felipeagferreira/Data-Science/blob/master/Projeto%20florestas%20aleat%C3%B3rias.ipynb): Explore publicly available data from [LendingClub.com.](https://render.githubusercontent.com/view/www.lendingclub.com), which connects people who need money (borrowers) with people who have money (investors). Fortunately, as an investor, you would like to invest in people who have shown a profile of having a high probability of paying you back. We create a model that helps to predict this.
.
     - [Natural Language Processing](https://github.com/felipeagferreira/Data-Science/blob/master/Natural%20Language%20Processing.ipynb): Discuss an overview of natural language processing, which basically consists of combining Machine Learning techniques with text and using mathematics and statistics to get that text into a format that machine learning algorithms can understand.

- ## Data Analysis and Visualization (Python Programming)
    - [Stock Market Analysis of Tech Stocks](https://github.com/felipeagferreira/Data-Science/blob/master/Data%20Analysis/Financial%20market%20data%20analysis%20project.ipynb): Analysis of exploratory stock price data to see the bank's actions and how they performed during the [financial crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%9308) until the beginning of 2016.
    - [Exploratory Data Analysis - Titanic Passenger Information](https://github.com/felipeagferreira/Data-Science/blob/master/CALIBRAR%20um%20DataFrame%20para%20operar%20com%20REGRESS%C3%83O%20LOG%C3%8DSTICA.ipynb): Simple analysis of passengers on board the Titanic answering common questions with visualizations. 
    - [Simple Linear Regression](https://github.com/felipeagferreira/Data-Science/blob/master/Machine%20Learning/Linear%20Regressions/Clothing%20Shop%20Efficiency.ipynb): Analyze data of a clothing shop to decide whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website in order to improve the efficiency of their business.
